## Description
**Pump Plunder** is a user friendly application that allows the user to find reasonable gas prices to their local proximity.

- The motivation for this app was around the quickly rising gas prices.
- We developed this app as a solution to finding the best price that is also close to us, to fill up our tanks. 
- **Pump Plunder** solves the problem of driving aimlessly to locate gas and gives the user the choice from gas stations located close to their proximity.
- We learned to work together ono the project communicate often and that there is more than one way to do something. This project was fun and I enjoyed working with **Team Pump Plunder**.
